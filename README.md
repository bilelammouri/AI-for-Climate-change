Abstract

This research attempts to amplify the precision of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission predictions through a comprehensive examination of machine learning regression models. The study addresses a critical gap in the existing literature by conducting an in-depth comparative analysis of various algorithms, including traditional linear models, decision trees, random forest, and advanced boosting techniques such as Adaptive Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Model (LGBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost. The investigation further delves into the involvement of performance metrics, encompassing Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared. Unlike previous studies, this research places significant emphasis on the holistic evaluation of these metrics to ensure a thorough understanding of model efficacy. Moreover, the research introduces an innovative dimension by incorporating feature selection techniques, notably the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) explainer model. This addition aims to unravel the influential variables affecting GHG emissions, providing not only model interpretability but also valuable insights for policymakers. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis of diverse set of time series variables within a single dataset, this research contributes novel insights into the application of machine learning regression models for GHG emission prediction. The outcomes promise to refine existing methodologies, bridge critical research gaps, and foster a more nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics underlying greenhouse gas emissions. The findings hold implications for environmental policy formulation and offer a pathway toward more accurate and interpretable GHG emission forecasting.
